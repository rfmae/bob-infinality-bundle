# bob-infinality-bundle

These are SlackBuilds & patches to rebuild some official packages in Slackware Linux,
are in test so be careful with the result in your system.

This branch uses the latest fontconfig release instead of the one included in Slackware.

## infinality-bundle project

*"infinality-bundle is a collection of software utilizing the power of font
rendering offered by infinality patches and fontconfig rules known as
fontconfig-infinality-ultimate."*

*  Project: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality-bundle+fonts
*  Source code: https://github.com/bohoomil/fontconfig-ultimate

## Using

**Important**: backup `/etc/fonts/` before you install fontconfig and remove any personal
configuration (`~/.fonts.conf`, `~/.fonts.conf.d` or `~/.config/fontconfig`) to avoid any
issue.

1.  Clone this repository

  ```
  root@darkstar:~# git clone https://github.com/rfmae/bob-infinality-bundle
  ```

2.  Build, remove and install packages following this order:

    1.  `source/l/freetype`
    2.  `source/x/fontconfig`
    3.  `source/l/cairo`

    Or just execute as root `install.sh`.

## Notes

*  This branch uses the latest fontconfig release and not the one included in Slackware.
*  I tried to make the minimal modificactions to the originals Slackbuilds.
*  There is not need to select a type of font rendering (Windows, Apple or Ubuntu)
   since the *"aim of infinality-bundle is to make use of the vast potential hidden
   in native Linux font rendering back-end"*. This does not mean you can not
   configure some aspects of the font rendering, please check:
   *  `/etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh`
   *  `/usr/doc/fontconfig-*/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate`
